My recreation of Asteroids by Atari
This project was originally completed in my Object-Oriented Programming course at BYU-Idaho

### Building the project

1. Clone or download the project
2. Locate the build.bat in the scripts folder to build the project for a desired platform
	- Use `build.bat vs2019` to build for Visual Studio 2019

### About
This project is a recreation of Atari's Asteroids. In this simple game, you control a spaceship and shoot bullets to break floating asteroids. You must avoid collisions with any asteroids or alien
spaceships.

This project helps in understanding Object-Oriented programming by using classes for the asteroids and spaceships. Likewise, inheritance plays a big part in this project.

Graphics were created with OpenGL using freeglut.

### Bugs
- TODO: fix crashes when firing bullets
