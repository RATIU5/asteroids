REM Renaming your project with a batch script is cooler
REM than manually changing your name everywhere ;)

REM What rename.bat does: Grabs the name of the premake5.lua workspace, and replaces all
REM occurences of that name with a new name in that file and renames the project folder too

REM ------------------------------USER----------------------------

REM Change this to the root of your project (default=%~dp0\..\)
set "root_dir=%~dp0\..\"
REM Change this to the name of your premake file (default=premake5.lua)
set file_to_rename=premake5.lua
REM Change this to 0 if you do not want to rename the folder (default=1)
set rename_folder=1
